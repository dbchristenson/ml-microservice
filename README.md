## About

This repository is about the **"ML Project Lifecycle"** and my ability to create dependable, deployable machine learning microservice applications which can be used for many things: MVPs, APIs, and more.

Because this project is more focused on ML Engineering as opposed to traditional model design, we will be setting up and working with a very simple model for this project.

If you are interested in some of my work in computer vision, model fine-tuning, parameter evaluation, data engineering pipelines, and more, you can check out my current work projects:
